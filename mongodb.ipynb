    "# Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are a category of databases that depart from the traditional tabular, structured model of relational databases. Instead of using fixed schemas and tables, non-relational databases offer flexible data models to store and manage data in various formats.\n",

    "# Dynamic Schema: When dealing with rapidly changing or unstructured data that doesn't fit well into a fixed schema.\n",
